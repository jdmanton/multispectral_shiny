# Spectral unmixing explorer

A simple R Shiny app for planning spectral unmixing fluorescence microscopy experiments using spectroscopic data from [fpbase.org](https://www.fpbase.org).
As of 2022-08-13, both initial blueshifted and redshifted dichroic sets for the PRISM detector are supported, along with the reflection mode (i.e. no beam blocks) of the Zeiss QUASAR detector.
This code is a little rough around the edges, so if the app crashes just try reloading and it will default back to known-good settings.
